# Recurrent-Neural-Network-Project

##Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to build a recurrent neural network that can predict if a book review is positive or negative. Two files are uploaded in this repository, which detail the positive and negative reviews. These reviews were appended together, where 80% were use for training and 20% were used for testing. Several models were created, but the best model was when the output_dim equals 10 and the number of epochs were 3. Overall, the model struggled to differentiate and accuractely assign in neutral cases, and even misidentified obvious cases as well. This may be solved with a more robust vocabulary for the model to be trained upon in the future.
